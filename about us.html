        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          The Students’ Forum envisions becoming a dynamic platform that
          transforms voices into influence, ideas into impact, and individuals
          into leaders. We seek to build a culture where every student—
          regardless of background—finds the courage to speak, the clarity to
          inspire, and the stage to shine. Our mission is to nurture confidence,
          creativity, and leadership, turning students into changemakers who
          uplift one another and leave a lasting impact.

        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>MENTORSHIP:</strong> Language training beyond college hours is
          given exclusively for all the students who volunteer for this program
          through a detailed syllabus provided by a top corporate company. In
          addition, students are taught public speaking by doing ice-breaking
          sessions and workshops. <br /><br />
          <strong>LANGUAGE TRAINING:</strong> Continuous exclusive sessions are
          held to enhance students’ soft skills like people skills, leadership,
          etc., to get through interviews and also to communicate effectively in
          their future academic as well as professional settings. <br /><br />
          <strong>WORKSHOPS:</strong> Geopolitics, Indian Polity, and
          performative speaking arts are taught to interested students in
          respective societies (MUN, DEBATE, and CULTURAL). Students also
          represent the college in external events through the MUN Delegation,
          Debate Contingent, and Cultural team. <br /><br />
          <strong>PRESENTATIONS:</strong> We regularly train students to present
          their papers, pitch ideas during hackathons, and deliver effective
          presentations. We emphasize verbal and non-verbal etiquette and give
          students the practice to confidently answer questions at these events.

        <h2>How We Do</h2>
        <p>
          At Speakers’ Forum, we know what it feels like to have something to
          say, but not know how to say it. We’ve all been there, hands shaking,
          voice trembling, thoughts racing. That’s why we’ve built a space where
          your voice is acknowledged and made stronger. ,<br /><br />
          Here, we don’t throw you on a stage and say, “go speak.”. We walk with
          you, step by step, building the confidence to stand tall, the clarity
          to speak well, and the presence to be remembered. <br /><br />
          <strong>Here’s how we make it happen:</strong><br /><br />
          • We recreate real pressure through MUNs, debates, and cultural
          events, not to scare, but to prepare you for the world. You’ll learn
          how to stay calm under pressure, speak with purpose, and think on your
          feet like the leaders you admire as you step into their shoes and
          discuss pressing issues.<br /><br />
          • Our public speaking classes are spaces for honest feedback, personal
          growth, and supportive learning. <br /><br />
          • Through sessions on resume writing, group discussions, and interview
          skills, we help you grow into someone who not only sounds confident
          but feels confident in any room.<br /><br />
          • With Computer-Assisted Language Learning, you’ll get to fine-tune
          your accent, pronunciation, and fluency.
