        <h2>Legacy Of The Forum</h2>
        <p>
          The Office Bearers of 2024–2025 completed their tenure leaving behind
          a legacy of dedication, creativity, and impactful initiatives.
          Throughout the year, they expanded the reach of the Speakers’ Forum,
          organizing a variety of events that encouraged students to develop
          public speaking, critical thinking, and leadership skills. Their
          approach combined structured planning with innovative ideas, ensuring
          that every workshop, debate, and simulation was both engaging and
          educational. Emphasis on mentorship and guidance allowed members to
          step out of their comfort zones, express themselves confidently, and
          actively participate in Forum activities. By blending established
          practices with new strategies, the 2024–2025 Office Bearers
          strengthened the organization’s framework, enhanced its reputation,
          and set high standards for professionalism. Their focus on
          collaboration, accountability, and inclusivity fostered a supportive
          environment where all members felt valued and motivated. The team’s
          achievements and strategic foresight have created a solid foundation
          for the incoming 2025–2026 Office Bearers to build upon, inspiring
          them to aim higher, innovate further, and carry forward the Forum’s
          vision with renewed energy.
